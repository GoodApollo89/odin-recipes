        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Like most people with coeliac, I find white bread is one of the foods our gluten-free family misses the most. I created this after much trial and error in trying to make a bread that tastes like real wheat bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>1 ¼ cups warm water</li>
            <li>1 ⅓ cups rice flour</li>
            <li>⅔ cup sorghum flour</li>
            <li>½ cup potato starch</li>
            <li>½ cup cornstarch</li>
            <li>⅓ cup vegetable oil</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon xanthan gum</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons salt</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <p>Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan.</p>
        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <p>Dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water in a bowl. Let stand until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 to 10 minutes.</p>
        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <p>Combine yeast mixture, rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, cornstarch, vegetable oil, eggs, xanthan gum, and salt together in the bowl of a stand mixer; mix on medium speed until incorporated, about 2 minutes. Spoon dough into the prepared loaf pan. Smooth the top of dough with the back of a wet spoon.</p>
        <h3>Step 4</h3>
        <p>Place dough in a warm place until it has risen just over the top of the loaf pan, about 1 hour.</p>
        <h3>Step 5</h3>
        <p>Preheat oven to 190 degrees C.</p>
        <h3>Step 6</h3>
        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until loaf is medium golden brown, about 25 minutes.</p>
